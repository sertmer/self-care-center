### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals of this project were to gain experience building an application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also to practice matching a given comp and increase understanding how to listen and respond to user events. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

As I practice more, writing DRY code becomes easier. I had trouble refactoring my code to accommodate the login form but once I psuedo-coded I was able to steer on the right course.
