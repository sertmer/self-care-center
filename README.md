# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I built a functional website that will give different mantra's and affirmations to help people struggling with self worth, self confidence and even more. These quotes can help people immensely and to be honest, they are helping me currenlty as I am struggling. Creating something to help others gives me great pride. I see the problem being centered around people who are struggling and this app can increase self worth and confidence just by these motivational quotes.  

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

To get this app running, you need to go to https://github.com/Jnguyen615/self-care-center, fork the project and then clone it to your machine using the SSH code and git clone. Type git clone + the SSH key to get a copy of the project on your local machine. From there you can open the page by typing open index.html, which will pull up the page on the browser. Then you will be able to navigate through the page, selecting mantras or affirmations to appear on the screen. You can enjoy seeing the messages and thinking about how they relate to your life or how you can use them in your life to make it better. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I am in Mod 1 at turing currently. This project made me think a lot, I spent a lot of time overthinking things before realizing my answers were all things that I already knew. I probaby spent around 15-20 hours on it to get it to work properly. We had a 6 days to complete it. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

I worked on this project solo. Here is the link to my github: https://github.com/Jnguyen615

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals for this project were to get experience building an app using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Using these tools I had to build the app from scratch using the provided colors for the background and text. I had to use eventListeners along with querySelectors to get events to happen on the page, and control when to hide buttons or show messages. This taught me about all the things you can do and I'm excited to use these skills moving forward in creating a more unique app.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

My favorite win was getting the error message to display properly, I was very proud of it! I am happy that I was able to manipulate things on the page to get the right placement and attibutes needed for it to function. The biggest challenge I faced was overthinking almost everything and spending a lot of time going down rabbit holes. I did learn a lot but none of it was what I really needed to make the app work. In the end it turned out to be things that I did know how to do. I struggled with positioning as well, but playing around a lot helped me work it out, using the console in chrome was my best friend for this. All in all I learned so much and can't wait to other projects.
