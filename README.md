For this project, the learning goals were to be able to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript. All the work was done on a MacBook Pro in VSCode. 
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- I was able to write sensible HTML and CSS.
- I was able to help other classmates out with issues they were having.

Challenges:
- Working alone was a challenge, but I was able to overcome that by asking for help from my peers, who nudged my in the right direction.
- Doing my CYOA of allowing the user to add their own message was difficult, and I got to a good place but I couldn't quite finish in time.
