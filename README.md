### Preview of App:

### Context:
[//]: <> I am on week three of the first mod in the turing program. This project took 3 days to finish, while working on other class assignements and preparing for our midmod assessment. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> Laurel Bonal @ https://github.com/laurelbonal 

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> In this project, we were learning how to use css and html, and how to get it to work with our javascript. This project was created using those three languages. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> I was able to do styling for iteration 0 within an hour or so, so i was really proud of myself! The javascript for iteration 1 was also really fun for me to do. For the CYOA, I chose to make a page where you can add, edit, and delete messages. This was much more difficult for me, and I spent almost a full day working on it and getting it perfect!
