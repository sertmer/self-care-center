# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- I built a desktop application that allows the user to receive randomly either a mantra or affirmation message. Ther user can favorite mantras and affirmations, go to a favorites view, and create their own message that will be added to the favorites view as well as the mantra/affirmation lists. 
- This application solves the problem of wanting a quick and easy way to receive a self care message. It solves this problem by providing a list of existing affirmations and mantras and allowing the user to simply click through these messages as well as favorite them into a list. 
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- They will need the link to the gitHub repository. Then, they can clone to their local machine following the instructions on the github site. Once the repo is cloned, they can use the terminal to enter the appropriate directory and run <open> to view the application in their browser. 
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- I was able to complete this project in around 6 hours during the third week of Turing mod1. 
### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
- I was the sole contributer. 
### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- I was able to go beyond the MVP requirements and completed both the error handling and favoriting fast follow features. 
- I was proud of my ability to spot and debug the application so the user experience was seamless. 
- I learned a lot about flexbox through self study which I applied to this project.
