# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras. Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert one's self-worth. Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. This app helps users remind themselves of their inherent value.
