### Abstract:
[//]: <> 
A random mantra or affirmation statement generator was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Users can select a mantra or affirmation statement and press a button to get a positive message! If a user doesn't like a particular message they can delete it so that it is not seen again and a pop up will confirm its deletion.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Challenge: After the page was designed (CSS and HTML) I began to work on the javascript portion of the project in order to make my page functional. I tried a few different approaches but nothing was seeming to work! Eventually I discovered that my default text color was white and that I was trying to generate text into a box with a white background. My code was working, but it wasn't visible! 

Win: I found a different way to hide the meditation icon! Adding 'hidden' to my javascript in order to hide the meditation icon wasn't as effective as using CSS directly to hide the icon text appears. 

Another Win AND Challenge: I tried to find the exact meditation icon on google and linking it from the web to my HTML file. After struggling with finding and linking the icon I talked to a peer and discovered that there is an .svg file that is already in our project. I was so happy to be able to have easy access to the icon!
