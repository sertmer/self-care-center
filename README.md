# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The webpage built to physically mimic the one posted with the assignment. Given limited CSS colors and font sizes, a prolem to solve was how to mimic the gradient wallpaper and estimating box sizes. 

For the actual project itself, the webpage offers a catalogue of Self-Care mantras and affirmations. The User has the ability to either generate a random mantra or affirmation, or in this one in particular add a new mantra to the list. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
The user has the ability to create their own mantras, which will open up a new box to enter. Once the user decides what mantra or affirmation they'd like to enter, it will be presented on the bottom box https://ibb.co/Phxg7mX

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am currently 3 weeks into Mod 1. The project probably took 18 hours to complete, as it took time to understand flexboxes and fine tune my understanding of the CSS/Java/HTML relationship
