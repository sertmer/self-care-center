### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I was able to build an app that randomly selects mantras or affirmations from two separate arrays based on user input, and posts them when the user clicks the receive message button! The app will also let you delete messages that users do not like, and the messages are removed from their respective array / will not be reposted.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

Simply access the application online, or via my github! If the app is cloned down from the main branch, it will be fully functional and available to be played with.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

(I'm not certain, but my last attempt at including a screenshot may have had something to do with the projects inability to be deployed. I'm going to hold off this time until that is figured out.)

With that being said, I really enjoyed the functionality to delete a message that the user doesn't like. The coding process to get there was made much simpler by what I learned in our previous duo project, and getting to flex that a little bit with an even cleaner approach felt really great! 

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

I think I worked on this project somewhere near 18 hours. It presented some unique challenges, but frankly I really did enjoy working solo on it. I am currently in Mod 1, going into week four on Tuesday!

Just me on this one! I did quite a bit of research to handle the stuff I was unfamiliar with, definitely a *lot* of chat gpt'ing to figure out my CSS elements.


### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The project was our first stab at a ground-up build including the HTML as well as the CSS, not to meantion reinforcing our JS scoding to build dynamic applications. 


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

1 - ABSOLUTELY my biggest win was completely refactoring most of my HTML build as well as a lot of the CSS attached with it. I really felt a bit lost on the proper way to structure things so that my flext elements would work out the way I wanted, and my first attempt was not great. After going back in and applying container div's to the correct spots, I definitely felt like it made my work in CSS a lot easier, and probably just made my HTML easier to read in general.  

2 - Outside of the HTML refactor, basically refactoring all of my initial CSS writeup felt really good too. I found some cool regarding the application of a reusable class element that I could reattach in my HTMl file, which I used for both my select / receive message containers! Doing my homework on radio buttons was fun too, I truly had no idea how to rescale those until I looked things up.

3 - LOVED looking through my previous project to figure out a good approach with my JS code, felt especially cool being able to reuse the getRandomIndex function. All in all, I feel like I did need to do a fair bit of research here as well to get to where I wanted, but I think that this project will definitely be another thing I can look back on for assistance when I'm working on future projects!

4 - (Last one, sorry.)

This project kinda really sent home the importance of being uber-specific with the naming of my variables. Last project I often felt pretty lost with what I came up with, and even though its kind of a small win, I felt that I handled it a lot better this time.
