# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The webpage has a chosen project of giving the user the ability to add a Self Care message to a catalogue of Self-Care mantras and affirmations. The User has the ability to either generate a random mantra or affirmation, or in this one in particular add a new mantra to the list. 

The page itself was to  built to physically mimic the one posted with the assignment. Given limited CSS colors and font sizes, a prolem to solve was how to mimic the gradient wallpaper and estimating box sizes. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1) Access the form here: https://github.com/zachwolek/self-care-center
2) Copy the SSH repository URL git@github.com:zachwolek/self-care-center.git
3) Open terminal and 'cd' into the directory you wish to clone 
4) Clone the repository by submitting `git clone git@github.com:zachwolek/self-care-center.git`

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
The user has the ability to create their own mantras, which will open up a new box to enter. Once the user decides what mantra or affirmation they'd like to enter, it will be presented on the bottom box https://ibb.co/Phxg7mX

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am currently 3 weeks into Mod 1. The project probably took 18 hours to complete, as it took time to understand flexboxes and fine tune my understanding of the CSS/Java/HTML relationship

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals were highly focused on CSS layout of designing a webpage. The tech worked with were primarily CSS with some JS and HTML to format the rest of the page. 

We specifically put a lot of focus into creating CSS selectors with property/value delcarations to format the page itself, and laying out the content largely using flexboxes. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1) I was incredibly alien to CSS before beginning at Turing, and had to overcome the challenge of learning how to fomat the page. Learning about the cascading properties of CSS helped understand targeting specific portions of your HTML. 

While I feel I understand it on a very basic level, I'm eager to learn how to clean up and make my organization tighter in formatting the page itself on CSS

2) I felt kind of shaky on the lessons learned from the group project last week, and had to teach myself a few JS/HTML interactive relationships I didn't feel I aborbed too well last week. By going through the lessons, asking teammates, sifting through forums, and watching several YouTube videos, I feel I have a much greater understanding of CSS/JS/HTML interrelationships
