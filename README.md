# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application allows the user to choose a message, either an affirmaton or mantra, that can be displayed randomly by selecting the button of their choosing. The user also has the opportunity to generate their own custom message, either selecting to create an affirmation or mantra, to be displayed on the screen. The app is solving the problem of coming up with your own motivation/mantra by allowing the user to randomly generate pre-written messages of encouragement. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- Fork this project to your own Github account
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- `cd` into the project
- Open the app in VS Code or code editor, open the browswer by running open index.html

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
The project was assigned on 4/4 and I had until 4/9 to complete it. I am repeating Mod1 and and three weeks in to this inning.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals were to work with buidling an app using HTML, CSS and JS. The HTML and CSS were desgined to match the comp given in the spec and the JS was used to make the app functional based on user interaction. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1.The biggest win was how quickly I was able to finish the project compared to last inning, I fully understood everything that I and I did not reference my old solo project from last inning at all. 
2.The other win was getting the created messages to add to the arrays in the data model. I really wanted to practice working with the data model since there is still some fuziness there. 

The challenges I faced were mostly with making small syntax errors that would throw off the whole codebase. Another challenge was refactoring, I want to get everything matched and functional as quickly as possible that I sometimes will sacrifice styling, which makes refactoring difficult and my own code hard to read. Definitely an area of growth.
