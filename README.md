### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <>
#### Wins:
1. I have never worked with CSS animation before nor have we touched on CSS all that much in class yet so it was rewarding to see what I researched come to life.
2. The amount of knowledge and confidence I gained in my technical ability from doing this project is a huge win.

#### Challenges:
1. I had a really hard getting the text to fade in every time I pushed the receive message button. I could get it to run with the first click, but had a really hard time repeating the experience without a page reload. I got it to repeat finally, but I couldn't get the animation to stop running and it would continuously fade text in until the button was clicked again. I researched more on the different animation properties and created a function to reset the animation from infinite to an animation iteration count of 1.
2. I also had a really hard time with the CSS loading animation, but once I figured out how to time methods out better, things started to fall into place. I reached out to my rock from Module 2, and her and another Module 2 classmate helped point me in the right direction.
