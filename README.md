# Self Care Center
## Welcome to the Self-Care-Center!
My goal is for you to leave this site more confident and relaxed than when you first entered.  This website allows you to receive an affirmation or a mantra to recite to feel empowered and capable.

### How to Navigate the Site
 - Click a button next to affirmation or mantra to determine which type of message you'd like yo receive  
![main screen](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/assets/self-care-center/self-care-0.png)

 - Click the "receive message" button
 - You're affirmation or mantra will appear at the bottom of the screen
![message appears](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/assets/self-care-center/self-care-1.png)

 - Don't like the message? Click on the "Don't Show Me This Again" button and that message will be removed from the possible list of messages you may receive
 - That's it! Repeat the process until you've reached zen

 I hope you enjoy this website and it gives you hope and comfort on your harder days!
