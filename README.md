### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I created a webpage that allows you to randomly receive a message from one of two types, and if you like said message to favorite it. You may view the favorites you have in a separate page, and the favorites you have will persist between page refreshes, as the favorites are stored using the localSession.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
One should only have to navigate to the deployment page, but if that fails, they can clone the branch down, then open the webpage in their browser of choice.


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I worked on this project for roughly 20 hours over the course of the week. I'm currently in week 3 of my first Turing mod.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project were to challenge ourselves and work independently, without referencing an outside code base beyond what we can simply google. I worked entirely with visual studio code and my browser, without any other programs or software.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I definitely think my biggest wins were finally managing to display the background correctly, and then managing to store the data in local storage correctly. These were my biggest wins because they were my biggest challenges; succeeding there was amazing.
